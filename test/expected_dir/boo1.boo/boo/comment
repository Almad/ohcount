//Create a new store that has two columns; the first is a Pixbuf (image) the second, a string.
//Bind the element in column 0 of the store to the pixbuf property in this column's CellRendererPixbuf!
//Detach the old column.
//Finally, attach the new column so it will be updated in real time.

//Grabs the TreeIter object that represents the currently selected node -- icky stuff with "ref" keyword. ;(
//In the second column we've stored the filename that represents the thumbnail image in the treeview.
//Grab this filename and then use it to inform the user what file he's viewing, as well as loading it.
//All of the widgets we want Autoconnect to hook up to Glade-created widgets in stuffBrowser.glade
//Run the application.
