% PROGRAM theta_logistic.m
%    Calculates by simulation the probability that a population
%    following the theta logistic model and starting at Nc will fall
%    below the quasi-extinction threshold Nx at or before time tmax
% SIMULATION PARAMETERS
% for butterflies (Euphydryas editha bayensis) at Jasper Ridge (population C)
% SIMULATION CODE
% OUTPUT CODE
% ComputeS quasi-extinction probability as the fraction of replicate
% populations that have hit the threshold by each future time,
% and plotS quasi-extinction probability vs. time
% Integrate solution exactly %
% Options=[];
% [T,true] = ode45(@logistic,[0,20],Nc,Options,r,K,theta);
% subplot(1,2,2)
% plot([1:tmax],P,'r.-',T,true,'g.-')
