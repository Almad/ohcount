# Suppose you want to spam your friend, and you have lots of
# friends. The solution is to write a program to do it. After a gander
# at python docs, one easily found the module for the job.
# see http://python.org/doc/2.3.4/lib/SMTP-example.html
# the code is a bit long with the command line, but the key lies at
# the bottom four lines. The gist is this:
####### test: strings - nonsense code follows
####### test done
# save this file as x.py and run it.
# it should send out the mail.
# the set_debuglevel() is nice because you see all the interactions
# with the smtp server. Useful when you want to see what's going on
# with a smtp server.
